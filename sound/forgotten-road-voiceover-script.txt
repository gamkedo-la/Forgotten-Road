Forgotten Road INTRO VOICEOVER SCRIPT

<Background – Town of Falldale>
For generations, the town of Falldale has stood as a quiet beacon of peace — a forgotten place, hidden deep within the woods of Dark Winter. Nestled among towering trees and the crumbling bones of ancient ruins, it endures in silence. Its people live simple lives: farming, forging, trading… and sharing half-believed tales passed down from the ancients.

<Background – Spooky woods with a Beholder lurking in the shadows>
They speak in hushed tones of a cursed forest, where treasure hunters vanish without a trace and strange lights drift between the trees. Of catacombs buried beneath cobbled streets, sealed long ago by ancestors who feared what they could not destroy. And of The Eye Below — a name spoken only by torchlight, whispered like a prayer… or a warning.

<Background – Picture of player character standing at the edge of the woods>
You are no hero.
Or are you?
To most, you’re just a traveler — staff in hand, crossbow slung at your side. Drawn here by rumors of gold, glory, or perhaps something deeper. You wield no magic. You rely on grit, simple weapons, and your own stubborn will. In Falldale, that might be enough… or it might not be.

<Background – Townspeople watching warily; dark clouds gathering overhead>
The townsfolk watch you closely. Some with hope. Others, with unease. They’ve seen the signs: Goblins, creeping from the woods beneath the moonlight. Skeletons, clawing from forgotten graves. And far beneath their feet, something ancient stirs.

<Background – Fade to black, faint glow of an eye opening underground>
Your choices will shape the fate of Falldale.
